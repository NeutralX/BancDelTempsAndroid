# Banco de tiempo // Time-based currency
This repository includes the final project of DAM ("Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma"). 

The idea of the application for android is like a "Wallapop" but instead of trading money you have to trade "time". 

Example: If you help someone building a library for 1 hour you can get "1 hour token". With this, someone can help you for 1 hour with anything you need.
But first, you have to create a post to explain what you need and the users of the community will apply to help you.

This application is built with Android (Java) and it allows you register and login with your user, create and delete your own posts, apply to help and view all the users registered.
